Performance Optimization Guide for GenomeScript

1. Memory Management:
   - Use memory-mapped files for large genomic data
   - Implement streaming parsers for FASTA/BAM files
   - Use generators for lazy evaluation
   
2. Parallel Processing:
   - Chunk large files for parallel processing
   - Use multiprocessing for CPU-intensive operations
   - Implement parallel quality filtering
   
3. Caching Strategy:
   - Cache frequently accessed genomic regions
   - Implement LRU cache for quality scores
   - Use disk-based caching for large datasets
   
4. I/O Optimization:
   - Use buffered reading for large files
   - Implement asynchronous I/O for file operations
   - Use compression for temporary files
   
5. Algorithm Optimization:
   - Use bit operations for sequence manipulation
   - Implement indexed access for random seeks
   - Use optimized data structures for quality scores
