# Load genomic data
LOAD FASTA "reference.fa" -> genome
LOAD VCF "variants.vcf" -> variants

# Analyze sequences
ANALYZE genome COUNT_GC -> gc_content
FILTER variants WHERE "QUAL >= 30" -> high_quality

# Train and predict
TRAIN MODEL ON variants WITH genome -> variant_model
PREDICT IMPACT variants USING variant_model -> predictions
